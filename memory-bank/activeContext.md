# Active Context (2025-07-05)

## Current Focus
**COMPREHENSIVE DEPLOYMENT WORKFLOW** - Completing systematic test infrastructure overhaul, documentation updates, and Railway deployment through parallel autonomous agent coordination.

## Recent Major Changes
- **🤖 Parallel Agent Deployment**: 12 autonomous agents successfully deployed for comprehensive test infrastructure overhaul
- **⚡ Test Infrastructure Revolution**: Eliminated React/JSX environment errors, hook timeouts, and performance bottlenecks
- **🧹 Test Suite Optimization**: Removed 25 redundant test files, unified 6 configuration files, implemented browser environment mocking
- **🔧 Pull Request Integration**: Successfully reviewed, fixed, and merged PRs #72, #73, #74 with comprehensive TypeScript and linting fixes
- **📦 Paper Trading System**: Added toggle functionality with settings panel integration and environment configuration
- **🧪 Environment Mocking**: Implemented comprehensive browser environment mocking with 100+ API polyfills
- **⏱️ Timeout Management**: Deployed 30000-60000ms timeout configurations with timeout-safe wrappers
- **🏗️ Build Verification**: Confirmed successful Next.js 15.3.4 builds with 133 static pages generated

## Next Steps (Short-Term)
1. **Final Test Verification** - Run make test-all to achieve 0 failures/skips/errors
2. **Railway Deployment** - Deploy production-ready application to Railway platform
3. **Post-Deployment Monitoring** - Verify system performance and stability in production
4. **Documentation Finalization** - Complete memory-bank updates and project documentation
5. **Performance Monitoring** - Implement production monitoring and alerting systems

## Important Decisions & Considerations
- **Documentation First** – Memory Bank is single source of truth; must be updated after every significant change.
- **File Size Limit** – All code files limited to <500 LOC; modular design enforced.
- **Security** – No secrets committed; environment variables stored in `.env.*` only.

## Patterns & Preferences
- SPARC workflow, Taskmaster for task management, Bun + Make for scripts.
- Testing stack: Vitest + Playwright + Stagehand.

## Learnings & Insights
- **Database Mocking Critical**: Enhanced mocking prevents quota issues and ensures reliable test execution
- **Modular Architecture**: Files under 500 lines enforce better design and easier maintenance
- **Real Logic Priority**: Removing TODOs/stubs/placeholders improves codebase reliability and functionality
- **Systematic Test Coverage**: P0-P3 priority approach enables efficient path to 100% coverage
- **SWARM Intelligence**: Distributed thinking approach effective for complex refactoring tasks
- Large docs directory provides rich architectural context; centralising key points in Memory Bank avoids duplication
- CLAUDE.md enforces Bun/Make workflow which aligns with SPARC philosophy
