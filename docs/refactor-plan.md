# Refactor Plan

This document outlines cleanup recommendations for the trading bot codebase and summarizes the changes implemented.

## Summary of Findings

- **Dead code**: Several modules in `src/services/trading/auto-sniping` and an outdated `target-processor` implementation were not referenced anywhere in the project.
- **Placeholder logic**: These files contained placeholder implementations for trade execution and position monitoring that were superseded by the newer `consolidated/core-trading` modules.

## Actions Taken

1. Removed the unused `src/services/trading/auto-sniping/` directory.
2. Removed `src/services/trading/consolidated/core-trading/target-processor.ts`, which exported an incomplete class.

The active sniping engine is implemented in `src/services/trading/consolidated/core-trading/auto-sniping.ts` and related modules.

## Recommended Next Steps

- Continue consolidating duplicate utilities and ensure only the optimized execution engine is exposed.
- Review TypeScript compiler settings to gradually enable strict mode for better type safety.
- Monitor code coverage and remove remaining orphaned files as the project evolves.
